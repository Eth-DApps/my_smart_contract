So, what is SafeMath? Long ago, there was an issue of 184 billion bitcoins being created because of a math problem in code. To prevent issues even remotely similar to these (not that this one in particular is possible in Ethereum), the SafeMath library exists. When two numbers are of the MAX_INT size (i.e. the maximum possible number in an operating system), summing them up would make the value “wrap around” to zero, like a car’s odometer being reset to 0 after reaching 999999 kilometers
